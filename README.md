# Transaction Anomaly Detection & Financial Risk Monitoring

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting anomalous financial transactions and assessing
their impact on fraud risk and financial exposure.

Using unsupervised anomaly detection techniques, the analysis supports
risk prioritization, fraud investigation, and financial control monitoring.

---

## Business Objectives
- Identify high-risk transactions based on abnormal behavior
- Quantify financial exposure linked to anomalies
- Evaluate the effectiveness of anomaly detection in capturing fraud
- Support audit, risk, and fraud investigation teams with actionable insights

---

## Dataset
Synthetic financial transaction dataset containing:

---

## Methodology
1. Exploratory Data Analysis to understand transaction behavior
2. Feature engineering focused on financial inconsistencies and risk signals
3. Unsupervised anomaly detection (Isolation Forest)
4. Scoring and classification of anomalous transactions
5. Visualization and monitoring using Power BI

---

## Key Results
- Anomaly rate: ~0.30%
- Fraud is highly concentrated within anomaly-flagged transactions
- Significant financial exposure identified in a small subset of transactions
- Clear prioritization of high-risk accounts for investigation

---

## Power BI Dashboard
The interactive dashboard includes:
- Transaction anomaly monitoring KPIs
- Fraud concentration analysis
- Risk severity matrix combining anomaly score and transaction amount
- Temporal anomaly trends
- Top risky origin accounts by financial exposure

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Power BI
- Data visualization & feature engineering
- GitHub for version control
